SKYWALKER: Spitzer Key Yield With All that Lightcurve Exoplanet Research

The Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) has a well known intrapixel effect in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron channels ([Knutson et al 2008](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2008ApJ...673..526K/abstract)). This sub-pixel sensitivity variation manifests itself as several variations in the photometric flux measured that is dependent on the sub-pixel of the PSF.  That is to say that the PSF walks along the sky and the flux read out varies as a result.
